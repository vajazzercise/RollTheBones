# DIE MAD

DIE MAD is an actually good online dice roller. There weren't any really good ones, so I'm making one. No offense, I mean the ones out there technically work... but this one is gonna be rad as hell.

## Feature List

 - 💚 = done
 - 💛 = started
 - ♥️ = not started
 - 💜 = might not ever do... who knows
 - 💙 = working fine but there will always be room to add more onto it

### Minimum Viable Product

 - 💚 2D dice physics and hit detection
 - 💚 Doing all the math for you
 - 💚 No ads

### Obvious Planned Features

 - 💙 Every kind of die imaginable
 - 💜 Drag and throw dice to roll (Without dice-on-dice hit detection, you should be able to drag dice off top of eachother without accidentally throwing it and losing your roll)
 - 💚 A cool logo and intro animation (EDIT: Good enough!)
 - 💙 A passable semi-modern UI

### SUPER COOL PLANNED FEATURES

 - 💚 Shake your phone to roll the dice!
 - 💙 Dice skins and table themes!
 - 💙 Cool animations for crit successes and crit fails!
 - ♥️ Advantage and disadvantage dice!
 - ♥️ Mario Paint/KidPix Studio style table clearing spells!
 - 💙 Settings menu where you can:
   - 💙 customize basically any of the features above
   - 💚 toggle AUTO-EXPLODING DICE
   - 💚 adjust your crit range and boring stuff like that
   - 💜 See my cute face in a credits screen and maybe donate to my kofi(???)

### INSANE OVER THE TOP FEATURES THAT I'M STILL GONNA DO

 - 💙 Achievements! Why not??
 - 💛 Turn this shit into a full on gatcha game. Dice packs! Crafting!
 - 💚 STILL ALL FREE AND WITH NO ADS!!!

### Impossible/Questionable/Stupid Features

 - 💚 Dice rolling animations (Look, there's only so much I can do before it gets too laggy. The web just wasn't built for this. EDIT: I WIN, BROWSERS)
 - 💚 Haptic feedback when dice hit an edge (don't even know if there's a web API for phone vibration. EDIT: THERE IS!!)
 - 💜 Sounds? I feel like nobody wants sounds. I know I don't at least... but maybe some day.
 - 💜 Presets like Fireball Dice (lots and lots of little orange D6s that leave a fire trail)
 - 💜 Some kind of reward for donating or something? I don't know about this one. I mean I want to keep every part of this free.
 - 💚 Saving your settings. (EDIT: COOKIES!!)
 - 💜 Literal Mode: Actually rolling bones for performing digital geomancy
 - 💜 Dice with all custom faces, not just numbers (why tho?)
