# Roll the Bones

Roll the Bones is an actually good online dice roller. There weren't any really good ones, so I'm making one. No offense, I mean the ones out there technically work... but this one is gonna be rad as hell.

## Feature List

âœ… = done
ðŸˆº = started
ðŸ†˜ = not started
ðŸ”® = who knows

### Already Implemented Features

 âœ… 2D dice physics and hit detection
 âœ… No ads

### Obvious Planned Features

 ðŸˆº Every kind of die imaginable
 ðŸˆº Doing all the math for you
 ðŸ”® Drag and throw dice to roll
 ðŸ†˜ A cool logo and intro animation
 ðŸˆº A passable modern UI

### SUPER COOL PLANNED FEATURES

 âœ… Shake your phone to roll the dice!
 ðŸˆº Dice skins and table themes!
 ðŸ†˜ Cool animations for crit successes and crit fails!
 ðŸ†˜ Advantage and disadvantage dice!
 ðŸ†˜ Mario Paint/KidPix Studio style table clearing spells!
 ðŸˆº Settings menu where you can:
   ðŸˆº customize basically any of the features above
   ðŸ†˜ toggle AUTO-EXPLODING DICE
   ðŸ†˜ adjust your crit range and boring stuff like that
   ðŸ†˜ See my cute face in a credits screen and maybe donate to my kofi(???)

### Impossible/Questionable/Stupid Features

 ðŸ”® Dice rolling animations (Look, there's only so much I can do before it gets too laggy. The web just wasn't built for this.)
 ðŸ”® Haptic feedback when dice hit an edge (don't even know if there's a web API for phone vibration, maybe impossible?)
 ðŸ”® Sounds? I feel like nobody wants sounds. I know I don't at least... but maybe some day.
 ðŸ”® Presets like Fireball Dice (lots and lots of little orange D6s that leave a fire trail)
 ðŸ”® Some kind of reward for donating or something? I don't know about this one. I mean I want to keep every part of this free.
 ðŸ”® Saving your settings. Now, this sounds like an obvious feature... but it would mean one of those big horrible Cookies Policy legal notices over part of the screen when you first visit. I DO NOT want to do that.
 ðŸ”® Literal Mode: Actually rolling bones for performing digital geomancy
 ðŸ”® Dice with all custom faces, not just numbers (why tho?)
